# 🏁 Final Whistle

**Trustless World Cup prediction markets on Solana — settled the second the whistle blows, by cryptographic proof instead of trust.**

Built for the TxODDS World Cup hackathon (*Prediction Markets and Settlement* track).

<p align="center">
  <em>Stakes live in an escrow no one controls. When the match is finalised, anyone can hand the escrow<br/>
  TxLINE's Merkle proof — the escrow verifies it on-chain and pays the winners. No oracle committee. No admin key.</em>
</p>

---

## What it does

1. **Auto-markets.** A keeper reads the TxLINE fixtures feed and opens parimutuel pools on-chain for every covered fixture: match winner (1X2) and total goals (O/U 2.5). Anyone can open additional markets — addresses are deterministic PDAs, creation is permissionless.
2. **Live experience.** The web app streams TxLINE's real-time scores and consensus odds (SSE) — live scoreboards, a match event feed (goals, cards, corners, VAR), implied-probability charts and price-movement history.
3. **Trustless settlement.** When TxLINE emits the `game_finalised` record (`period 100`), the keeper fetches the Merkle proof for the final stats (`/api/scores/stat-validation`) and calls the escrow's `settle` instruction. The escrow program **CPIs into TxLINE's `validate_stat_v2`** and only unlocks funds if the oracle program verifies the proof against the daily Merkle root anchored on Solana by TxODDS.
4. **Verifiable receipts.** Every settled market gets a receipt page showing the full evidence chain — final stats, the exact predicate that was proven, the Merkle path sizes, the root PDA and the settlement transaction — plus a **"Verify in my browser"** button that re-runs `validate_stat_v2` as a read-only simulation from the visitor's own browser. Don't trust us; ask the chain.

### Why the settlement is actually trustless

The `settle` instruction is **permissionless** — any keeper, any user, anyone can call it. Cheating is prevented by four deterministic check gates inside the program (`program/programs/finalwhistle/src/lib.rs`):

| Gate | What it stops |
|---|---|
| `payload.fixture_id == market.fixture_id` | proofs from a different match |
| stat keys must be the market's settlement keys, `period == 100` | proofs of half-time / in-play records posing as final |
| roots account must be the canonical TxLINE `daily_scores_roots` PDA for the proof's epoch day | attacker-supplied root accounts |
| predicate is **built by the program** from market params + claimed outcome, then proven via CPI `validate_stat_v2 == true` | claiming the wrong winner — the Merkle proof itself refutes it |

If nobody can produce a valid proof (fixture cancelled, coverage dropped), a time-locked `void_expired` path lets every bettor reclaim their stake. No funds can get stuck; no human can pick winners.

- **`program/`** — Anchor program (Rust). Parimutuel escrow + proof-gated settlement via `declare_program!(txoracle)` CPI.
- **`server/`** — TypeScript keeper: TxLINE auth, fixtures→markets sync, SSE ingest + relay, settlement bot, demo replay.
- **`web/`** — React (Vite + Tailwind). Live markets, wallet betting, portfolio, verifiable receipts.
- **`scripts/`** — devnet setup (wallet, TxLINE free-tier subscription, token activation).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install                        # root, server and web workspaces

# 1) one-time: wallet + TxLINE devnet free-tier subscription + API token
node scripts/setup-devnet.mjs      # writes .env.devnet

# 2) build + deploy the program (or use the already-deployed devnet program id)
cd program && anchor build && anchor deploy && cd ..

# 3) run
npm run dev -w server              # keeper + API on :8787
npm run dev -w web                 # UI on :5173 (proxies /api)
```

Production: `npm run build -w web` then `npm start -w server` — the server serves the built UI and everything runs off one port. A `Dockerfile` is included.

### Demo replay (because judging happens after the final)

Matches end before review, so the server includes a **replay mode** that re-broadcasts a finished fixture's *real* TxLINE score records as if live, then performs a *real* on-chain settlement with the *real* Merkle proof of its finalised record — only the pacing is simulated:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8787/api/demo/start?fixtureId=<id>&speed=4&bettingSecs=60"
```

## TxLINE endpoints used

| on-chain `subscribe` + `POST /api/token/activate` | devnet free-tier API token |
| `GET /api/fixtures/snapshot` | fixture discovery → auto market creation |
| `GET /api/scores/stream` (SSE) | live scoreboards, event feed, finalisation detection |
| `GET /api/odds/stream` (SSE) | consensus odds, implied probability, price history |
| `GET /api/scores/snapshot/{id}`, `/api/scores/historical/{id}` | state recovery + demo replay |
| `GET /api/scores/stat-validation?statKeys=…` | Merkle proofs for settlement (`validateStatV2` shape) |
| on-chain `txoracle.validate_stat_v2` (CPI + browser simulation) | trustless outcome verification |
